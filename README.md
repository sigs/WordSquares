A simple C++ solver for dense word grids.

See this [YouTube Video](https://youtu.be/zWIsnrxL-Zc) for the best explanation.

## Tweakables

In `main.cpp`, you can tweak the following parameters:

- `PRINT_NUM_SOLUTIONS`: Whether to only print the number of solutions, set false to actually print all of the solutions.
- `WORD_FREQUENCY_FILE`: The path to the word frequency file.
- `SIZE_W`: The width of the word grid.
- `SIZE_H`: The height of the word grid.
- `DIAGONALS`: Whether to include diagonals in the word grid.

See main.cpp for more details.
